# Snake Reinforcement Game

Created and maintained by [@surbhipsychtutor](https://www.youtube.com/@surbhipsychtutor) 💻📘

Welcome to the **Snake Reinforcement Game**, a classic twist on the original Snake game — designed to demonstrate the **psychological principles of rewards and consequences** using interactive gameplay. It's not just about getting a high score — it's about understanding **reinforcement in action**.

This game is a **practical demonstration of Operant Conditioning** by B.F. Skinner. Here's how it connects:

- **Positive Reinforcement**: Eating food increases score (reward for desired behavior).
- **Negative Consequence**: Hitting the wall or your tail ends the game (punishment for undesired action).
- Encourages players to repeat behavior patterns that lead to **rewards**, and avoid those that lead to **consequences**.

Great for:
- Psychology students
